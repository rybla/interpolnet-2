# This GitHub Action workflow automatically approves and enables auto-merge for Pull Requests created by the Jules autonomous coding agent.
# It is organized into a single job that triggers whenever a new pull request is opened or synchronized.
# The job first checks if the actor triggering the PR is the Jules bot.
# If true, it uses the GitHub CLI to submit an approving review and then enables auto-merge with the squash method.
# To use this, place it in your repository at .github/workflows/jules-automerge.yml.
