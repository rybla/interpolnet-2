# Interpolnet 2

This is the **Interpolnet Project**, a giant collection of intereseting self-contained single-page application web demos.

Each demo must follow these guidelines:

- Use a distinct, unique, and consistent color scheme and typography.
- Use many passive and active animations to indicate what elements are interactable, and when things change in response to either automatic updates or user input.
- Ensure that the webpage is designed to be mobile-friendly.
- Use a responsive design.
- Demonstrate a single, consistent idea as the focus webpage.
- Include many links to other pages in this project's website.
