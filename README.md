# Interpolnet 2

This is the **Interpolnet Project** version 2, a giant collection of intereseting self-contained single-page application web demos.

## Demo Guidelines

Each demo must follow these guidelines:

- Use a distinct, unique, and consistent color scheme and typography.
- Use many passive and active animations to indicate what elements are interactable, and when things change in response to either automatic updates or user input.
- Ensure that the webpage is designed to be mobile-friendly.
- Use a responsive design.
- Demonstrate a single, consistent idea as the focus webpage.

## Organization

The directory `public/` contains a collection of sub-directories, where each sub-directory corresponds to a single demo. Each demo's sub-directory contains ALL the files (HTM, JavaScript, CSS, etc) required for the demo.

The directory `notes/` contains all notes about the project. The file `notes/Directory.md` contains a section for each demo in the project. The section heading contains the name of the demo and a link to the demo's URL. The section content contains a detailed description of the demo's design and implementation.

The directory `screenshots/` contains a collection of screenshots of the demos working.

The directories `scripts/` and `src/` contains utility scripts that are used for building the project during CI. NEVER EDIT these files!
