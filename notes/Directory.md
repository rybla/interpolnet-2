## Falling Sand Physics Simulation [[demo](https://rybla.github.io/interpolnet-2/falling-sand)]

A falling-sand style physics simulation. The user can choose from a variety of different materials to place into the world:

- Sand has gravity and spreads out with high friction.
- Water has gravity and spreads out with no friction.
- Stone has no gravity and stays in place.
- Plant has no gravity and grows upwards.
- Ooze is like water but spreads out very slowly and sticks together.
- Steam is like water but with inverse gravity.
- Lava is like water but spreads out slower. Lava melts sand into stone. Lava boils water into steam. Lava burns plant and ooze into steam.

## UI Design Playground [[demo](https://rybla.github.io/interpolnet-2/ui-design-playground)]

A UI design playground that lets users tweak CSS variables for a mock dashboard and immediately see the results on typography and layout.

### Features
- **Mock Dashboard**: A realistic looking dashboard UI containing cards, charts placeholders, lists, and various form elements.
- **Real-time Customization**: A control panel that allows users to adjust:
    - **Colors**: Primary brand color, background colors, surface colors, and text colors.
    - **Typography**: Base font size, heading scale, and font families.
    - **Spacing**: Base spacing unit which scales padding and margins.
    - **Borders**: Border radius for cards and buttons.
- **Instant Feedback**: Changes in the control panel are immediately reflected in the dashboard.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, with a collapsible control panel on smaller screens.

### Design Goals
- **Interactive Learning**: Help users understand how CSS variables affect a design system.
- **Visual Consistency**: Demonstrate how a few variables can control the look and feel of an entire application.
- **Usability**: Provide an intuitive interface for tweaking design tokens without writing code.

### Implementation Plan
- **HTML**: Structure the page with a split view: a sidebar for controls and a main area for the mock dashboard. The dashboard will use semantic HTML for better accessibility and structure.
- **CSS**: Heavily rely on CSS Custom Properties (Variables) for all themable values. Flexbox and Grid will be used for layout. The dashboard will have a distinct visual style that can be drastically altered by the variables.
- **JavaScript**: Listen for `input` events on the control panel inputs and update the `style` attribute of the document root (or a wrapper element) to set the new CSS variable values.

## Lambda Calculus Visualizer [[demo](https://rybla.github.io/interpolnet-2/lambda-calculus-visualizer)]

An interactive lambda calculus evaluator that visually steps through beta reductions and highlights bound variables as the execution progresses. This tool is designed to help students and enthusiasts understand the core mechanics of functional programming and lambda calculus through visualization.

### Features
- **Expression Input**: A text input area where users can type lambda calculus expressions. Supported syntax includes standard notation (e.g., `λx.x`, `(\x.x)`, or just `\x.x`).
- **Visual Representation**: The expression is rendered as a tree or a nested structure of boxes, making the structure of applications and abstractions clear.
- **Step-by-Step Evaluation**: Users can click a "Step" button to perform a single beta reduction.
- **Highlighting**:
    - **Redex Identification**: The next reducible expression (redex) is highlighted.
    - **Variable Binding**: Hovering over a lambda abstraction highlights all occurrences of its bound variable. Hovering over a variable highlights the lambda that binds it.
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions when substituting variables and reducing expressions to make the transformation process easy to follow.
- **Predefined Examples**: A dropdown menu with classic combinators (e.g., I, K, S, Y, Church numerals) to quickly load and explore.

### Design Goals
- **Clarity**: The primary goal is to demystify beta reduction. The visual feedback should make it obvious *what* is being replaced and *where*.
- **Interactivity**: Immediate feedback on syntax errors and the ability to interact with the visual elements (hovering, clicking) enhances learning.
- **Aesthetics**: A clean, modern interface with a soothing color palette (e.g., dark mode with neon accents for highlighting) to make the abstract math feel approachable and engaging.

### Implementation Plan
- **Parser**: Implement a recursive descent parser in JavaScript to convert the string input into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The AST will support Abstractions (`λx.body`), Applications (`(f a)`), and Variables (`x`).
- **Evaluator**: Implement a reducer that finds the leftmost-outermost redex (normal order reduction). It needs to handle alpha-conversion to avoid variable capture (renaming variables when necessary).
- **Renderer**:
    - Map the AST to DOM elements. Abstractions will be containers with a header (the lambda and variable) and a body. Applications will be containers holding the function and the argument side-by-side.
    - Use CSS Flexbox for layout.
- **Animation**: Use the Web Animations API or CSS transitions. When a reduction happens:
    1. Highlight the redex.
    2. Animate the argument moving into the positions of the bound variable in the function body.
    3. Replace the redex with the reduced body.
- **State Management**: Keep track of the current AST and the history of reduction steps to allow "Undo" or "Reset" functionality.

## Hindley-Milner Type Inference Visualizer [[demo](https://rybla.github.io/interpolnet-2/hm-type-inference-visualizer)]

An interactive tool that visualizes the Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm. Users input functional programming expressions (similar to lambda calculus but with `let` bindings), and the system infers the type, showing the unification process and the resulting type tree.

### Features
- **Expression Input**: Supports lambda calculus syntax plus `let` bindings (e.g., `let id = \x.x in id`).
- **Real-time Inference**: Updates the type inference as the user types.
- **Unification Visualization**: Shows the constraints generated and how they are solved (unified).
- **Type Tree Visualization**: Visually represents the inferred type as a tree structure.
- **Interactive AST**: Hovering over parts of the expression highlights the corresponding type constraints.

### Design Goals
- **Educational**: Help users understand how type inference works "under the hood".
- **Visual**: Use diagrams (trees/graphs) to represent types and constraints.
- **Clean UI**: Minimalist interface focusing on the code and the visualization.

### Implementation Plan
- **Parser**: Implement a parser for a mini-functional language.
    - AST nodes: `Var`, `Abs` (lambda), `App`, `Let`, `Lit` (Int, Bool).
- **Type System**:
    - Types: `TVar` (type variable), `TCon` (type constructor like Int, Bool), `TArr` (function arrow).
    - **Inference Algorithm**: Implement Algorithm W to generate constraints and substitutions.
    - **Unification**: Solve constraints, maintaining a substitution map.
- **Visualization**:
    - **AST View**: Display the parsed expression structure.
    - **Constraint View**: List generated constraints.
    - **Substitution View**: Show current variable mappings (e.g., `a -> Int`).
    - **Type Tree**: Render the final type using a tree layout using HTML/CSS.
- **UI/UX**:
    - Split screen: Code input on one side, Visualization on the other.
    - Color coding for type variables to track them easily.

## Dynamic AST Visualizer [[demo](https://rybla.github.io/interpolnet-2/dynamic-ast-visualizer)]

An interactive tool that visualizes the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of a custom C-like programming language in real-time. As the user types code, the tree structure grows, prunes, and updates dynamically.

### Features
- **Real-time Parsing**: Code is parsed on every keystroke (with debouncing) to generate an AST.
- **Dynamic Tree Visualization**: The AST is rendered as a node-link diagram using SVG.
- **Bidirectional Highlighting**:
    - Hovering over a node in the tree highlights the corresponding code in the editor.
    - Hovering over code highlights the corresponding node in the tree.
- **Collapsible Branches**: Users can click on tree nodes to collapse or expand branches to focus on specific parts of the code.
- **Zoom and Pan**: The visualization area supports zooming and panning to navigate large ASTs.

### Design Goals
- **Educational**: Provide a clear visual representation of how source code translates into a hierarchical structure.
- ** responsiveness**: Ensure the visualization updates smoothly and feels responsive to user input.
- **Aesthetics**: Use a clean, modern design with smooth animations for tree updates (nodes entering/exiting).

### Implementation Plan
- **Parser**: Implement a recursive descent parser for a subset of C-like syntax.
    - Supported constructs: `function`, `var`, `if`, `while`, `return`, binary operations, function calls.
    - Output: A JSON-like tree structure where each node contains its type, value (if applicable), children, and source code range (start/end indices).
- **Layout Engine**: Implement a tree layout algorithm (e.g., Reingold-Tilford) to calculate x/y coordinates for each node.
- **Renderer**:
    - Use SVG for rendering nodes (circles/rectangles) and edges (lines/curves).
    - Use CSS transitions for smooth movement of nodes when the tree structure changes.
- **Code Editor**: A `textarea` for input, with a synchronized overlay for syntax highlighting and range highlighting.
- **Interaction Logic**:
    - Map source ranges to AST nodes.
    - Handle mouse events for hovering and clicking.
    - Implement zoom/pan logic for the SVG container.
