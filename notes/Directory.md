## Falling Sand Physics Simulation [[demo](https://rybla.github.io/interpolnet-2/falling-sand)]

A falling-sand style physics simulation. The user can choose from a variety of different materials to place into the world:

- Sand has gravity and spreads out with high friction.
- Water has gravity and spreads out with no friction.
- Stone has no gravity and stays in place.
- Plant has no gravity and grows upwards.
- Ooze is like water but spreads out very slowly and sticks together.
- Steam is like water but with inverse gravity.
- Lava is like water but spreads out slower. Lava melts sand into stone. Lava boils water into steam. Lava burns plant and ooze into steam.
